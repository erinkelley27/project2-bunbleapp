# Bunble

## Description

Bunble is an app that matches users with cheeseburgers that they might like. On the homepage, the user can select a cheeseburger based on an image, name and description. After clicking through, they will learn more about the burger, the type of bun, the type of meat and all of the toppings. Here, they also have the opportunity to leave a comment.

Eventually, I would like one individual burger to randomly populate on the home page. I would also like to add a feature that allows the user to save their favorites.
